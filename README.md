The Canton of Basel-City publishes a variety of geographic and statistical data on the subject of food. These are open data, but not yet state of the art Open Government Data (OGD) - i.e. not yet been published in a completely standardized way. A series of datasets have been recommended for use and improvement at the Open Food Data Hackdays from the [Statistical Portal](http://www.statistik.bs.ch/zahlen/tabellen.html) (statistik.bs.ch)
